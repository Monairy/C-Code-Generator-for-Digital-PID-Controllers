## Objective

Digital Control (CSE372 Control Systems 2) term project aims at developing a configurable and buildable C-code library for generic RST digital controller.
Simulation of closed loop control should be done on a simulator or evaluation board (e.g. TivaC EVB) for Arm Cortex M4 platform. 
Project ends at real time simulation or/and emulation of process and controller in closed loop.
One type of load disturbance is considered.
User should be able to configure process discrete (continuous is an option) model and desired tracking and regulation performance.
Student is to develop a calculation engine tool that design the correct structure and parameters of the RST controller. 
Then, generates the proper library runnable on target.
